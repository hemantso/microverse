          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
              University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the
              "National Youth Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
              in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
              how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
              Forestry Service
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
              laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
              returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
              pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
              Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
              work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
              other applied science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology

              <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
              leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
              pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
              different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
              varieties for each major climate on Earth.
